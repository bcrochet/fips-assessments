1) After OpenShift Pipelines operator is deployed via OLM, create a new project pipelines-tutorial
oc new-project pipelines-tutorial
and verify that a service account "pipline" has been created in this project.
2) This test uses a sample application that includes a [frontend](https://github.com/jianrongzhang89/pipelines-vote-ui) and [backend](https://github.com/jianrongzhang89/pipelines-vote-api).
3) Deploy the pipeline and pipelineruns using the .yaml files in this directory.
4) After several minutes, the two pipelinerun CRs should have status condition type "Succeeded" with value "True".
oc get pipelineruns
